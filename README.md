# PFL
PR00F Foundation Library

Collection of some useful routines used across my projects. Compiles into static lib.

The Visual Studio project file is included.<br/>
However, if you want to see example of integration in other projects, you may be interested in the Visual Studio solution including other projects as well in [PGE-misc](https://github.com/proof88/PGE-misc) repo.
