# PFL
PR00F Foundation Library

Collection of some useful routines (file system, math, bit manipulation, etc.) used across my projects. Compiles into static lib.

This project is unit-tested, however the tests are in the [repository of PGE](https://github.com/proof88/PGE/blob/master/PGE/UnitTests/PFLTest.h).

The Visual Studio project file is included.<br/>
However, if you want to see example of integration in other projects, you may be interested in the Visual Studio solution including other projects as well in [PGE-misc](https://github.com/proof88/PGE-misc) repo.
